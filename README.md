# Conservation_Website_Ruby_Project

After 4 weeks of study at CodeClan, I was pesented with the following brief to consolidate of my current learning Ruby fundamentals, TDD, Object Oriented Programming, Web Programming and Database interactions.

### Animal Shelter

The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until 
they can be adopted by a new owner. The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. 
Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners. 

#### MVP: 

 - A list of all their animals and their admission date
 - Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable
 - Assign an animal to a new owner
 - List all the owners and their adopted animals

#### Possible Extensions:

 - CRUD actions for animals/owners
 - Have separate pages for animals ready for adoption and ones still in training/vet care
 - Search for animals by breed/type
 - Any other ideas you might come up with

After spending a day in planning out classes, database tables and the basic structure of my website, I approached the
instructor team to see if I could swap the basic theme from an Animal Shelter to a Conservation Society.
 
This Conservation society only having a minor modification to the brief. Animals and Members would have a Many-to-Many
relationship in the database, the join table would have a class representing its existence and the final product would be
slightly differentiated from the many other Animal Shelters produced by my classmates.

During the implementation, I learnt a great deal about debugging issues raised in all three sectors of Model, View and Controller.
  * Trying to insertinformation into databases/tables/columns that didn't exist
  * Methods calling on things that weren't in their scope.
  * Views that didn't exist or HTML code that wasn't in place.
  * and most importantly the great beast that is CSS and how to get my head around it on the fly.
  
I managed to implement most of the MVP and strangely enough some of the extensions(like CRUD actions) within the first
two days of coding out my pre-made plan. Things started to go awry as I began down the not-so-recently-travelled path of 
HTML/CSS.
Buttons and images that were in perfect positions before I add the image were suddenly on the opposite side of my view.
Slowly and with much research and help from colleagues and staff it slowly made itself into some kind of shape.
I noticed though that everyone had great advice, but for the most part fit best to their own style of design and 
sense of space. 

Being able to listen to their ideas and extract the information that would help me the most saw this project take on its
present form. It is not completed, but at present I am quite happy with the results. A few of the buttons need to be
changed.
I learnt a lot during this project and I look forward to learning more as I refactor and continue personal study of
